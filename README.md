# Cups and Balls Game

## Overview
This repository contains two versions of a classic "Cups and Balls" guessing game:

1. **Python Console Version** — a simple terminal-based game using Python’s `random` module.
2. **JavaScript Web Version** — an interactive browser-based game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (DOM manipulation).

## Motivation
I originally built the Python console version during my second year of B.Tech as a small project to understand randomness and user input handling. Later, I decided to transform it into a web-based interactive game to practice front-end development and improve my JavaScript skills.

## Features

### Python Version
- Simple command-line interface
- Random ball placement under one of three cups
- User guesses the position
- Option to continue or quit after each round

### JavaScript Version
- Responsive web UI with 3 cups and ball images
- Shuffle animation to simulate cups mixing
- Interactive cup selection with win/lose feedback
- Replay option without page reload

## Technologies Used
- Python 3 (random module)
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (DOM manipulation)
- No external libraries or frameworks

## What I Learned
- Basic game logic and randomness in Python
- User interaction and input validation in the terminal
- Frontend development with dynamic UI updates using JavaScript
- Animations and CSS transitions for better user experience
- The importance of breaking problems down and iterative development
